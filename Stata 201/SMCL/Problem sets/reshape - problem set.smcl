{pstd}We have a dataset of summer Olympic medal wins:

{phang}{bf:{stata `"use "Raw/Olympics 1", clear"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}Each observation is a list of sports in which a country medaled.
Observations are identified by country and the year of the Olympics:

{phang}{bf:{stata `"isid country year"'}}{p_end}
{phang}{bf:{stata `"browse"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}However, the sport variables are a mess.
It is not clear how they are ordered (time? medal class?),
but we want them to be alphabetical.
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(a)}

{pstd}Sort across the sport variables,
so that {cmd:sport1} is a country's alphabetically first sport,
{cmd:sport2} the second, and so on.
(The sport variables are numeric,
but the values of the value label are sorted by sport name:
{bf:{stata label list sport}})
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(b)}

{pstd}Create a variable named {cmd:sportchange} that is {cmd:1}
if a country's sports list changed since its last medaling year,
and {cmd:0} if not.
There are multiple approaches to {bf:(b)}!
{txt}{sf}{ul off}{...}

{pstd}{bf:(c)}

{pstd}Create a variable named {cmd:nochange} that is {cmd:1}
if a country has never seen a change in its sports list from
one medaling year to the next, and {cmd:0} otherwise.
How many countries always win the same medals?

{pstd}{bf:Question 2}

{hline}

{pstd}For variables that are lists, such as {cmd:sports},
{cmd:reshape} allows manipulation beyond sorting.

{pstd}The following is a dataset of one list variable, {cmd:s2_q8},
a question that allowed respondents to choose up to 4 of 12 possible options:

{phang}{bf:{stata `"use Raw/s2_q8, clear"'}}{p_end}

{phang}{bf:{stata `"browse"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}You can see that {cmd:s2_q8} is already internally sorted.
However, it is still not possible to use the variable for analysis.

{pstd}Using {cmd:reshape}, create dummy variables for all 12 options.
For each option, if a list contains that option, the option's dummy variable should equal {cmd:1};
otherwise it should equal {cmd:0}. For example:

{phang}{bf:{stata `"list in 1"'}}{p_end}

{pstd}In observation 1, the dummy variable for option {cmd:1} would equal {cmd:0},
since the list does not contain {cmd:1}.
However, the dummy variable for option {cmd:5} would equal {cmd:1}.
