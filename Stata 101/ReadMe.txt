Open "Stata_101.docx" in Microsoft Word to begin the training. A lecturer can lead a training by reading through this file and its exercises with a group, or single learners can read through this file on their own. 

The answers in "Stata_101.docx" are invisible (formatted in the color white). Learners can either highlight/reformat the answers, or open the second document "Stata_101_Answers.docx" to view the answers (formatted in the color black).
